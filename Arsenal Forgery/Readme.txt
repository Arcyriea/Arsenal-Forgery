The link to the ships download: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10t0fhGLxZ9eIFwO2Lyy8lGUtJzB1rp40?usp=sharing

Please extract the .zip folder containing the additional ships files I have opted out into this mod folder if you wish to play with them here. If you download from the github there is no need to do that here.

However if you wish to download AF without most of the large ships go to: https://steamworkshopdownloader.io/
And copy the https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=433982918 into their site.

Also please note that you can edit the region.lua file of Altered Vanilla, replace whatever number of the ambient section in any faction's 
region with an "-1" to unlock Arsenal Forgery's alternate game mode feature where customizable building of each faction come into plays
(along with custom plants for each faction)

Find the folder ID numbered as "754363293" in the workshop folder of your Steam's steamapps directory~ That's Altered Vanilla's mod folder
