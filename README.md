That attempts to explain some stuffs peoples have no idea how to uses

Final Forgery (old) is the old version of AF (in 2018) where at that time frag weapons hadn't came in yet. (Just don't activate it at the same time as AF, not using both at once)... Althrough for. AF I might still attempting to convert the frag to normal weapons now or fix them so they fit with vanilla.

Ignore these two files called ".gitattributes" and "_config.yml". They have nothing to do with the mod.

You can use this mod outside steam folder but the blocks ID won't be relocated if use with other non-steam mods which could make it more open to mod conflicts, be noted however that you are creating a separate copy of the mod itself which won't be in sync with the ones on the Steam workshop folders, if this is your choice you can choose to place the folder locally at: 

Drive:\Users\yourname\Saved Games\Reassembly\mods\

^Please do not accidentally upload / "publish" my mod to the workshop.
