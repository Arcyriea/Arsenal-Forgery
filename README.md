INSTALLATION NOTE FOR MANUALLY PATCHING THE MOD

Please rename the whole "Arsenal Forgery" folder to "433982918" then put the folder at Drive:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\329130\ if you are using the Steam version of the game. Place it on your steam workshop folder where you got the directory installed, in order to manually patch the mod if you opt into the beta version of Reassembly, remember to back up the original steam folder of the mod.

Warning: ONLY DO THIS WHEN YOU ARE USING THE BETA BRANCH VERSION RATHER THAN THE LIVE VERSION OF THE GAME AS IT COULD CAUSE ERRORS AND MISSING BLOCKS

To find out how to use the Beta version of the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlrH2QpESTI or https://www.wikihow.com/Enable-Steam-Beta

Ignore these two files called ".gitattributes" and "_config.yml". They have nothing to do with the mod.

You can use this mod outside steam folder but, the blocks ID won't be relocated if use with other non-steam mods which could make it more open to mod conflicts. Sometimes the Beta Version is current with the Live Version, which would mean that you are free to not do any manual patching at the time.
