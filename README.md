INSTALLATION NOTE FOR MANUALLY PATCHING THE MOD TO USE WITH THE BETA BRANCH OF REASSEMBLY

Please rename the whole "Arsenal Forgery" folder to "433982918" then put the folder at ..\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\329130\ if you are using the Steam version of the game. Place it on your steam workshop folder where you got the directory installed (locate exactly where the folder 329130 is by using the search function), overwrite the original steam folder of the mod & manually patch the mod if you opt into the beta version of Reassembly, remember to back up the original steam folder of the mod before this.

Warning: ONLY DO THIS WHEN YOU ARE USING THE BETA BRANCH VERSION RATHER THAN THE LIVE VERSION OF THE GAME AS IT COULD CAUSE ERRORS AND MISSING BLOCKS, POSSIBLY CORRUPT YOUR SAVES.

To find out how to use the Beta version of the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlrH2QpESTI or https://www.wikihow.com/Enable-Steam-Beta

Ignore these two files called ".gitattributes" and "_config.yml". They have nothing to do with the mod.

You can use this mod outside steam folder but the blocks ID won't be relocated if use with other non-steam mods which could make it more open to mod conflicts, be noted however that you are creating a separate copy of the mod itself which won't be in sync with the ones on the Steam workshop folders, if this is your choice you can choose to place the folder locally at: Drive:\Users\yourname\Saved Games\Reassembly\mods\

^Please do not accidentally upload / "publish" my mod to the workshop.

(Sometimes the Beta Version would be current with the Live Version (basically there is no beta at all currently for testing), which would mean that you are free to not do any manual patching at the time. This statement is only to be considered when Arthur has push a beta build to the live build)

The mod will not automatically update (like reverting itself, or just simply pruned some features only from beta) after doing the manual patch, it only does when I upload a new version of the mod directly to Steam. If such a case happens, feel free to go back here and download new version of the archive and unzip the patch again.
