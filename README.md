Please rename the whole "Arsenal Forgery" folder to "433982918" then put the folder at Drive:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\329130\ if you are using the Steam version of the game. Place it on your steam workshop folder where you got the directory installed, in order to manually patch the mod if you opt into the beta version of Reassembly

Warning: ONLY DO THIS WHEN YOU ARE USING THE BETA BRANCH VERSION RATHER THAN THE LIVE VERSION AS IT COULD CAUSE ERRORS AND MISSING BLOCKS
